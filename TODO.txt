TODO LIST

related to the code :  
* matrix calcul
* make a gloabl tour of the code for the memory leaks and check with valgrind
*  main < 100 lignes ?
    * put events handling in other file than main ? (in interface ? or an other class)
    * try to put the deletion of a sold in the events handling (it will short the code and make it vissualy cleaner)
